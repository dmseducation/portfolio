          <li>React Hooks: </li>
          <p>
            I leverage React hooks to manage state and side effects in
            functional components, using hooks like useState, useEffect, and
            useReducer to streamline component logic and improve performance.
          </p>
          <li>Routing:</li>
          <p>
            I have experience with React Router for implementing navigation
            within single-page applications, handling dynamic routing, and
            managing user navigation.
          </p>
          <li>Styling</li>
          <p>
            I use various styling solutions, including CSS modules,

            responsive designs that align with modern UI/UX standards.
          </p>
          <li>Performance Optimization:</li>
          <p>
            I am adept at optimizing React applications for performance,
            employing techniques like code splitting, lazy loading, and
            memoization to enhance user experience
          </p>
          <li>Testing: </li>
          <p>
            I am familiar with testing frameworks such as Jest and React Testing
            Library, and I write unit and integration tests to ensure the
            reliability and functionality of my components.
          </p>
          <li>API Integration:</li>
          <p>
            I have experience in integrating RESTful APIs and GraphQL with React
