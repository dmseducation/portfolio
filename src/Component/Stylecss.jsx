            <li>CSS Syntax and Selectors:</li>
            <p>
              I am proficient in writing clean, efficient CSS code using a
              variety of selectors, including class, ID, attribute,
              pseudo-classes, and pseudo-elements. I know how to apply styles
              efficiently and organize CSS to maintain scalability and
              readability.
            </p>
            <li>Responsive Design:</li>
            <p>
              I excel at creating responsive designs using CSS media queries,
              fluid grids, and flexible layouts. I am skilled in making websites
              adapt to various screen sizes and devices, ensuring a consistent
              user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
            </p>
            <li>CSS Flexbox and Grid:</li>
            <p>
              I have in-depth knowledge of CSS Flexbox and Grid layout systems,
              using them to build complex, responsive layouts without relying on
              float-based layouts. I can efficiently design grid-based
              interfaces with precise control over alignment, spacing, and
              responsiveness.
            </p>
            <li>Animations and Transitions: </li>
            <p>
              I am proficient in using CSS animations and transitions to add
              interactivity and dynamic effects to web pages. I use @keyframes,
              transform, transition, and other animation properties to enhance
              user engagement and visual appeal.
            </p>

            <li>Preprocessors (SCSS/SASS):</li>
            <p>
              I have experience using CSS preprocessors like SASS and SCSS to
              write more maintainable and reusable stylesheets. I can utilize
              variables, nesting, mixins, and functions to streamline and
              optimize the styling process.
            </p>
            <li>CSS Frameworks:</li>
            <p>
              I am familiar with CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap and
              Foundation, leveraging their grid systems and pre-built components
              to speed up development. I know how to customize these frameworks
              to meet specific design needs.
            </p>
            <li>CSS Variables (Custom Properties):</li>
            <p>
              I have experience using CSS variables to create dynamic and
              reusable styles, allowing for easy customization and theming of
              web applications. I can effectively manage color schemes, fonts,
              and other design tokens using variables.
            </p>
            <li>CSS3 Features:</li>
            <p>
              I utilize modern CSS3 features such as gradients, shadows,
              borders, and transforms to create visually appealing designs. I am
              proficient in using advanced selectors and pseudo-elements to
              target specific elements for styling.
            </p>
            <li>Cross-Browser Compatibility:</li>
            <p>
              I am well-versed in ensuring that CSS works consistently across
              different browsers by applying vendor prefixes where necessary and
              using feature detection tools like Modernizr to handle
              inconsistencies.
            </p>
            <li>Performance Optimization:</li>
            <p>
              I understand how to optimize CSS for performance by minimizing
              file size, reducing the use of unnecessary selectors, and
              implementing best practices like critical CSS and deferred loading
              for above-the-fold content.
