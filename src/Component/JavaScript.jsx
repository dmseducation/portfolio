            <li>Core JavaScript (ES6+):</li>
            <p>
              I am proficient in writing modern JavaScript, utilizing features
              introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and beyond, such as let, const,
              arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, and spread/rest
              operators. I follow best practices in writing clean, maintainable
              code.
            </p>
            <li>DOM Manipulation:</li>
            <p>
              I am skilled in interacting with the Document Object Model (DOM),
              using JavaScript methods like getElementById(), querySelector(),
              and addEventListener() to dynamically update and manipulate HTML
              content and styles based on user interaction.
            </p>
            <li>Asynchronous Programming:</li>
            <p>
              I am proficient in handling asynchronous operations using
              Promises, async/await, and callback functions. I am familiar with
              techniques for managing asynchronous tasks like fetching data from
              APIs or handling timeouts and intervals.
            </p>
            <li>Event Handling:</li>
            <p>
              I have extensive experience with event-driven programming in
              JavaScript. I can handle user interactions such as clicks, form
              submissions, key presses, and other events, ensuring responsive
              and interactive user experiences.
            </p>

            <li>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</li>
            <p>
              I understand object-oriented principles in JavaScript, including
              prototypes, classes, inheritance, and encapsulation. I can create
              and work with objects, use constructor functions, and implement
              class-based inheritance for more structured code.
            </p>
            <li>JavaScript Modules:</li>
            <p>
              I am proficient in using JavaScript modules (ES Modules and
              CommonJS) to organize code into reusable, maintainable pieces. I
              know how to import/export modules, manage dependencies, and follow
              modular design patterns.
            </p>
            <li>JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries:</li>
            <p>
              I have experience with popular JavaScript libraries and frameworks
              like React, Angular, and jQuery. I can integrate and extend the
              capabilities of JavaScript through these tools, working on both
              client-side and server-side logic.
            </p>
            <li>Functional Programming:</li>
            <p>
              I am familiar with functional programming concepts in JavaScript,
              such as higher-order functions, pure functions, closures, and
              immutability. I frequently use array methods like map(), filter(),
              reduce(), and forEach() to process data.
            </p>
            <li>JavaScript Performance Optimization:</li>
            <p>
              I understand techniques to optimize JavaScript performance,
              including minimizing DOM access, reducing redundant operations,
              and efficiently managing memory and garbage collection.
            </p>
            <li>Cross-Browser Compatibility:</li>
            <p>
              I ensure JavaScript code works consistently across different
              browsers by handling feature detection, using polyfills when
              necessary, and following web standards.
