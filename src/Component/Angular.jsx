      <h1>Skill in AngularJs</h1>
      <p>
        I am an Angular developer with a strong background in building robust
        and scalable web applications using Angular. My expertise includes:
      </p>
      <div className="RContainerText">
        <ol>
          <li>Component-Based Architecture: </li>
          <p>
            I excel at designing and implementing Angular components, services,
            and modules to create modular, maintainable, and reusable code.
          </p>
          <li>Data Binding: </li>
          <p>
            I am proficient in using Angular’s data binding features, including
            one-way data binding, two-way data binding, and property binding, to
            synchronize data between the model and view seamlessly.
          </p>
          <li>Directives and Pipes: </li>
          <p>
            I utilize Angular’s built-in directives and pipes, as well as create
            custom ones, to enhance the functionality of components and improve
            the efficiency of data transformation and display.
          </p>
          <li>Dependency Injection:</li>
          <p>
            I leverage Angular’s dependency injection system to manage services
            and dependencies, ensuring modular and testable code.
          </p>
          <li>Routing and Navigation:</li>
          <p>
            I have experience with Angular Router for implementing navigation
            and routing within single-page applications, managing route
            parameters, and configuring route guards for security and user
            access control.
          </p>
          <li>Reactive Programming:</li>
          <p>
            I am skilled in using RxJS to handle asynchronous operations and
            manage data streams, employing operators like map, filter, and
            mergeMap to handle complex data interactions.
          </p>
          <li>Forms Management: </li>
          <p>
            I am proficient in Angular’s reactive and template-driven forms,
            including form validation and custom validators, to build dynamic
            and interactive user input forms.
          </p>
          <li>Performance Optimization:</li>
          <p>
            I apply techniques such as lazy loading, change detection
            strategies, and trackBy functions to optimize Angular applications
            for performance and responsiveness.
          </p>
          <li>Testing: </li>
          <p>
            I use testing frameworks such as Jasmine and Karma to write unit and
            end-to-end tests for Angular applications, ensuring code quality and
            reliability.
          </p>
          <li>State Management:</li>
          <p>
            I am familiar with state management solutions like NgRx and Akita
            for managing complex application state and ensuring predictable
            state changes.
          </p>
          <li>API Integration:</li>
          <p>
            I integrate RESTful APIs and GraphQL with Angular applications,
            handling data fetching, error handling, and managing asynchronous
            interactions effectively.
          </p>
          <li>Version Control:</li>
          <p>
            I use Git for version control and collaborate with teams using
            platforms like GitHub to manage code changes, track issues, and
            coordinate development efforts.
